    <p id="description">Congrats you found sloane! The fact remains that Sloane's a girl,<br>
        so she must be somebody's love interest, right? That's what the <br>
        film seems to suggest by propping Sloane up as such a thin character.<br>
        If nothing else, she's there to run interference between Ferris and Cameron.<br>
        At the Von Steuben Parade, when Cameron thinks Ferris has ditched them and<br>
        gets worked up accordingly, Sloane talks him off the ledge.<br>
        So Sloane seems like a solid friend; beyond that, however,<br>
        we don't know much about her.</p>
